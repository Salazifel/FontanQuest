Fontan Quest is a Digital Health Application Prototype to encourage children, aged 6-12, that underwent Fontan surgery to do Sports regularly. To achieve that, a colony builder strategy has been implemented that spans the overarching story to several mini-games of sports. Furthermore, the parents are encouraged to let their kids do Sports. 
The game is based on recent findings in Fontan Surgery Rehabilitation and supported by Health Professionals.

To start the App, install Unity and download the Fontan Quest Folder. Then you can run the App for Demo.
