# FontanQuest

FontanQuest is an innovative Digital Health Application Prototype aimed at motivating children, aged 6-12, who have undergone Fontan surgery to engage in regular physical activity. Developed as part of the Exergames Project at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, under the guidance of the Chair of Information Systems, especially Gamification, this project is a collaborative effort between academia and healthcare professionals.

## Project Contributors

The initial development of the FontanQuest application was spearheaded by:
- Hannes Jacobi
- Laura Rabadan
- Iftekhar Alam Joy
- Alisa Schulz

In 2023, the project continued with contributions from:
- Hannes Jacobi
- Shu-Man Cheng
- Christina Netta
- Firat Turgay

Special thanks to Dr. Dr. Isabelle Schöffl from the Universitätsklinikum Erlangen for her support throughout the project.

## Project Overview

FontanQuest utilizes a colony builder strategy intertwined with an engaging storyline and a variety of mini-games centered around sports activities. The overarching goal is to encourage children post-Fontan surgery to adopt a physically active lifestyle. Moreover, the application aims to involve parents in supporting and promoting their children's participation in sports.

The game mechanics and design are informed by recent research in Fontan Surgery Rehabilitation, ensuring that the activities are both enjoyable and beneficial for the target audience. FontanQuest is a testament to the potential of gamification in promoting health and wellness among children facing unique medical challenges.

FontanQuest leverages Garmin Smartwatches to connect live data to our games, enhancing the interactive experience and providing real-time feedback to players.
